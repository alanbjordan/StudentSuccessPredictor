## **Overview**

This project demonstrates how machine learning can assist in predicting early **student success** in an online education program. The goal is to use onboarding assessment and early participation data from the first 30 days to identify which students are likely to succeed â€” and which ones may need early intervention.

## **What's Inside**

- **Predictive Modeling**  
  Deployed a **Logistic Regression** classification algorithm to predict student success based on early behavioral and performance data.

- **LLM Integration**

  This LLM integration bridges the gap between raw predictive outputs and practical decision-making:
    - Interpretability: The LLM translates numerical predictions into meaningful narratives.
    - Personalization: Recommendations are customized based on individual student data and behavioral personas.
    - Efficiency: Educators receive instant, detailed feedback without needing to manually analyze model results.

## **Business Use Case**

By predicting student success early, education teams can:
- Design **targeted interventions** for at-risk learners
- Reduce Student Churn
- Improve overall student engagement and outcomes
- Allocate tutoring resources more effectively

> This is a demonstration of how machine learning, and generative AI can work together to turn behavioral and performance data into **actionable insights**.
